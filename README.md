# irac - 'a p2p instant messenger for tor'-ish
irac is supposed to give you a peer-to-peer (audio-) chat solution that is
easy to set-up and easy to use.

This is work in progress and not ready for field use.

Similar to [TorChat](https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat).

## Installation
    $ sudo npm install irac (TODO: publish when ready ;)
    $ sudo npm install git://github.com/hakt0r/irac.git

## Usage
    $ irac     (normal usage)
    $ irac-gui (start gui, duh)
      --nick='anonymous'
      --port=33023
      --torport=9051
      --config=~/.irac
    $ irac id       (prints your user-id and public key)
    $ irac tor      (starts only the tor instance with hidden service)
    $ irac port     (prints the tor and irac port-numbers)
    $ irac devinit  (dowloads node-webit and rebuilds modules)
    $ irac devgui   (runs the node-webit gui, requires successful devinit)
    $ irac buildgui (builds the node-webkit gui, requires successful devinit)
    $ irac pack     (builds a releaseable node-webkit package)
